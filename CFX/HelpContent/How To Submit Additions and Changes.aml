    <introduction>
      <para>The CFX Standard and the CFX SDK continue to grow and evolve via the contributions of the CFX community, under the direction and oversight of the IPC.  
      All CFX message structures, and functions of the CFX SDK are maintained on GitHub as an open source project that is open and available to all.  
      Members of the IPC Connected Factory Exchange Committee (2-17) may submit requests to change or augment the CFX message structures and SDK 
      capabilities via the GitHub site.  These requests are then reviewed by the IPC, and once approved, merged into the next publication of the CFX Standard.
	  </para>
	  <para>This guide explains the process for submitting these change requests via GitHub.  In order to submit requests, you must have a GitHub account, and be
	  a member of the GitHub CFX team.  Any member of the IPC 2-17 Connected Factory Exchange Committee is eligible to become a member of the GitHub CFX team.
