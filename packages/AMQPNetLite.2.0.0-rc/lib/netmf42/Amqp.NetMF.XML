            An address has the following form:<para/>

            Where domain can be:<para/>
              host | ip | name<para/>
            If "amqps" is specified, the connection uses TLS in the underlying transport.
            When port is not specified, it is set to the standard based on scheme (amqp: 5672, amqps: 5671)
            path is not used by the library.
            Note that TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) is signaled only for "amqps" addresses where
            the domain is host | name. SNI is not signaled when the domain is a numeric IP address.
